# Budgie 2 TODO

- Show correct initial balance
  - Account may have an initial balance from before the view window
  - Need to expand all transactions starting from the oldest initial balance
  - Can probably simplify to date, source, sink, amount for this calculation
- Show a dot or arrow next to today
  - Right of table? Between rows if no transactions today?
  - Maybe just bold the date column if today has transactions?
  - Or divide the table up somehow?
- Show month dividers
- Show balances for all accounts
- Build single account view?
- Add reccurrences to new transactions
  - Dropdown to choose an existing recurrence pattern for now
- Edit transactions?
- Edit recurrence patterns?
- Figure out how to deal with exceptions
  - My rent is a different amount every month -- should it still be a recurring transaction?
  - Maybe what I need is just a way to duplicate an existing transaction
- Hook it up to a remote object store
- Add user accounts and authentication
